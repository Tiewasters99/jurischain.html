# JurisChain: Distributed Legal Interpretation Network

## Overview
Interactive visualization of blockchain-based legal validation system, developed as part of research on (Con)Textualism theory. See below. 

## Theoretical Background
This visualization connects to my theoretical work by attempting to imagine what a new crypto-AI mode of validation of legal opinion might look like, as part of the process of assessing how legal interpreation will be radically transformed in the era of AI. This process is inscribed within a theoretical interpretative framework I call (Con)textualism, a triple concept holding that interpretation in the age of AI must respond to three separate concerns (1) it must be sensitive to the AI context, with for example, an understaning of the "context window" and the political and economic context of AI development, (2) it must be sensitive to and address the "negative" aspects of AI interpretation, the fragility of memory, the ephemerality of the "text," the unreliability of the AI "narrator" and the reasons therefore, among others, and (3) it must respond to the constitutional, foundational challenges of AI with a kind of "whole of society" response, analogous to the convocation of the Estates General before the French Revolution. 

## How to Use
Instructions for the interactive elements: tap directly on buttons identified as interactive, in this case the blue buttons above the diagram, to unlock interactive features. 

## Technical Details
Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, no dependencies with Claude. 

## Academic Context
Connection to Dworkin's chain novel metaphor, constitutional AI concerns, cryptocurrency, legal theory, new methods of interpretation in the age of AI. 

## Future Development
This visualization may evolve as my own thinking on (con)textualism evolves and as I interact with additional academic shcolarship and other technical developments.
